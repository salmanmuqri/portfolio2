## Features Overview

### Dynamic Role Text

The role text (`Student`, `Developer`, `Tech Enthusiast`, etc.) dynamically changes every 2 seconds, adding a bit of interaction to the homepage.

### Custom Cursor

The page features two custom cursor effects. One is a small cursor that follows the mouse, and another is a larger cursor that follows the smaller one, creating an interactive, playful user experience.

### Project Gallery

The project section showcases various projects I've worked on, each with a brief description, and links to view the project live or to access the source code on GitHub.



## Custom Styles & Animations

- **Glitch Text Effect**: The glitch effect is applied to headings like "M.Salman Muqri" and "About Me" for visual interest. It gives the text a "glitching" animation that cycles between different visual states.
  
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The website uses smooth scrolling for internal links to enhance user experience.

- **Interactive Button Hover Effects**: Buttons on the page have a hover effect where the cursor size changes when hovering over interactive elements, adding an extra layer of engagement.
